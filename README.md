This is a work in progress, dont expect a complete codebase. 

This is a project of mine to learn how to combine rust, Bevy (game engine for simulations), Rapier (for physics), to implement AI gym. 
These technologies should allow for a fast and parallel computation that should work well with reinforcement learning, where getting the fitness score of individuals in a population often is the main bottleneck. 


test edit in place on github
